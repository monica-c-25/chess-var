# chess-var
This variant of chess is played in the console and developed as a portfolio project for the CS 162 W'23 term.

There are some modifications to the rules:
1) The winner is the first player to capture all of an opponent's pieces of one type. Fro example, capturing all of an opponent's would win the gane.
2) The king isn't a special piece and thus, there is no check or checkmate.
3) There is no casting, en passant, or pawn promotion.

This variant still contains the same following rules:
1) Pieces will move and capture as in standard chess.
2) Pawns will move two spaces forward on their first turn only.
3) Pawns have to capture diagonally.

Locations on the board will be called on by using "algebraic notation" with columns labeled a-h and rows 1-8.
